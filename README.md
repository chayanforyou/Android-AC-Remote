# Android-AC-Remote
This project is intended to be an android app to control any Air conditioning unit with an unkown IR protocol once the protocol of the device has been reverse engineered.  
For this initial commit the project only supports a single Carrier device but it shouldn't be very hard to edit the values to fit any AC protocol. 
Future commits will add some support for protocols that are found on online archives as well as some way to use your own protocol either in IRP notation or an easier parameter notation within the application or using a file.
